This MATLAB application allows you to plot some data of the COVID19 disease. You can find the dataset [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases). In this project there is a [MATLAB code](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/COVID19/blob/master/COVID19.m) and a [MATLAB graphic application](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/COVID19/tree/master/MATLAB_App) developed using MATLAB App Designer. 

There are nine kind of charts:
* total confirmed
* total recovered
* total deaths
* daily % confirmed cases growth
* daily % recovered cases growth
* daily % deaths cases growth
* daily confirmed cases growth and its linear regression model
* daily recovered cases growth and its linear regression model
* daily deaths cases growth and its linear regression model

# MATLAB Application
There is a variable called "nation" with which you can select the desired country and a variable "saving_enabled" if you want to save the charts plotted. The charts are saved [here](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/COVID19/tree/master/Charts) and are available in two formats ([.png](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/COVID19/tree/master/Charts/PNG) and [.eps](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/COVID19/tree/master/Charts/EPS)). 
This is an exampe of linear regression for daily confirmed cases in Italy.

# MATLAB Graphic Application
You can download the installer for the standalone application (without Matlab) [here](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/COVID19/blob/master/MATLAB_App/for_redistribution/MyAppInstaller_web.exe). The following image shows an example of usage of the application.

You can choose nine types of charts for all the nations around the world.
